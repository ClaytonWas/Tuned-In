## How It Works

### Content Extraction

When you click "Generate," the extension injects Mozilla's [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library into the active tab. Readability strips away navigation, ads, and boilerplate to extract the article's core text content—the same algorithm that powers Firefox's Reader View.

### On-Device Summarization

The extracted text is fed to Chrome's experimental [Summarizer API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/summarizer-api), which runs **Gemini Nano** locally on your device. No data is sent to external servers.

For long pages, the text is chunked (configurable 1K–10K characters) and summarized in passes:
1. Each chunk is summarized independently
2. Chunk summaries are concatenated
3. If the combined summary exceeds the model limit, it's summarized again into a final condensed form

The summarizer is instantiated once per session and reused—no repeated model loading.

### Musical Analysis

The summary is passed back through the same on-device model with a structured prompt that requests:
- **BPM** (tempo): 60–180, mapped from the content's perceived energy
- **Genres**: 2–3 music genres matching the content's mood

The prompt explicitly constrains output to valid Spotify seed genres and prevents the model from suggesting content-based genres like "thriller" or "documentary."

Example output:
```
bpm: 110
genres: ["indie", "chill", "folk"]
```

### Genre Mapping

AI-suggested genres are normalized to Spotify's supported seed genres via a mapping table. This handles synonyms (`hip hop` → `hip-hop`, `r&b` → `r-n-b`) and mood-to-genre conversions (`romantic` → `r-n-b`, `aggressive` → `metal`).

Invalid genres are filtered against Spotify's [official seed genre list](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-recommendations). If nothing maps, fallback genres (`pop`, `chill`) are used.

### Audio Feature Calculation

BPM is converted to Spotify audio feature targets:

| BPM Range | Energy | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| < 80 | 0.2–0.4 | Slow, ambient |
| 80–100 | 0.3–0.5 | Chill, mellow |
| 100–120 | 0.4–0.6 | Moderate, groovy |
| 120–140 | 0.6–0.8 | Upbeat, driving |
| 140+ | 0.7–1.0 | Fast, intense |

Valence (musical positivity) is derived from genre keywords:
- `sad`, `melancholic` → 0.2
- `aggressive`, `metal` → 0.3
- `romantic`, `chill` → 0.6
- `happy`, `party` → 0.8

### Track Search Strategy

The extension employs a multi-strategy approach to find the best match:

**Strategy 1: Genre-Filtered Search**

Queries Spotify's Search API with `genre:` filters:
```
genre:indie genre:chill
```

Multiple genre combinations are tried (single, dual, triple) with randomization for variety. Tempo keywords are occasionally added as a secondary signal, but deprioritized since they're unreliable in track metadata.

**Strategy 2: Multi-Genre Text Search**

Falls back to plain text queries combining genre names:
```
indie chill folk
```

**Strategy 3: Playlist Mining**

Searches for playlists matching the genre profile, then samples tracks from a random result. This surfaces tracks that wouldn't appear in direct searches.

**Strategy 4: Simple Fallback**

Single-genre search with no filters—ensures something always returns.

### Track Scoring

Since Spotify deprecated the Audio Features API for free-tier apps, tracks are scored using:

| Factor | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Genre relevance | 85% | Track/artist name contains genre keywords |
| Popularity | 7.5% | Spotify popularity metric (0–100) |
| Tempo relevance | 7.5% | Bonus-only; tempo keywords in track name |

Tracks are scored, sorted, then artist-diversified—taking the top track from each unique artist before filling the pool with remaining high-scorers. A random selection from this pool ensures variety across runs.

### Popularity Filtering

The dual-range slider sets min/max popularity bounds. If no tracks fall within the range, bounds expand by ±10 iteratively until matches are found or the full 0–100 range is used.
